This is a Selenium bot for buying a given sneaker from the Nike Snkrs website ON RELEASE DAY.
It will not work for sneakers that are past their release day (or later in the release day).
This is because the purchase page changes to where the buy button redirects to a seperate checkout page (as opposed to a direct buy popup during release).
It is a commandline script written solely in python. `Please run with python 3.7.`
There are 6 selenium drivers in the bin directory for both Chrome and Firefox on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
